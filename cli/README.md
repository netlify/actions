This Action enables arbitrary actions with the [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli)

## Secrets

  [Obtain one with the UI](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/#obtain-a-token-in-the-netlify-ui)
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` - *Optional* API site ID of the site you wanna work on
  [Obtain it from the UI](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/#link-with-an-environment-variable)
  
## Outputs

The following outputs will be available from a step that uses this action:
- `NETLIFY_URL`, the URL of the draft site that Netlify provides
- `NETLIFY_LOGS_URL`, the URL where the logs from the deploy can be found
- `NETLIFY_LIVE_URL`, the URL of the "real" site, set only if `--prod` was passed

> The full stdout from the run of the `netlify` command is printed in the GitHub Actions workflow logs.
